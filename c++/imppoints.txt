 Ternary operator has precedence : RIGHT -> LEFT
 Assignment operator "=" has precedence : RIGHT -> LEFT

 True : 1 False : 0


 HIERARCHY OF OPERATORS :
 ()  >  */%  >  +-  >  <<=>>=  >  ==!=   >  &&  >  ||

 If two numbers are input in terminal with space '_' b/w them, they are treated as two seperate inputs
 eg. 49 single input
     4 9 two inputs
     4+9 three inputs


if(expression) turns into boolean 
in boolean, any number except 0 means True
so if(5) means true, so condition works
if (0) is false, condition will not work


for(;condition;) // valid code

break : leave sthe loop
continue : skips to the next iteration

for pattern printing : 
outside loop : no of rows
inside loop : no of columns

Functions:
main functions int main() always runs first before other void functions

after the function called ends, the line shifts back to the function where it was called and proceeds fron there.

created function void() should be above main() function

void() does not return value. int,float,etc functions return the same type of value

if function returm type is int() then the finalm value returned should also be an INTEGER        

#include<cmath> for sqrt()

scope : variable declared inside 'for" fn can be modified and printed only within those functions

variables have diff uses in different functions eg. hello(int i) not same as bye(int i) in the same code

cout<<&x : address of variable

global variable : declared outside any function eg main() void() int() etc

default values in parameters must be gven to each variable eg. int fun(i=1,j=2,k=3)

global variable gets modified globally if modified locally

POINTERS :
cout<<sizeof(datatype) gives bytes of space for that datatype

ARRAY is PPASSED BY REFERENCE  to other functions(address is passed), updating the array will update it in all the functions.
